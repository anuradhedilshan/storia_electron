May I suggest the following prioritization:

1. Storia: Implement the option to set a separate location/path for the temp file. 
If possible, it would be great to be able to set the location once and then remember the path 
for both the temp file and the output file

2. Storia: it would be great if the IP/proxies could be 
imported (e.g. a text file with every proxy parameter on a line) vs 
the current option of copy-paste in a window. I can provide the text file 
I use for copy-pasting into the window


3. Storia: if possible to implement shortcuts/triggers to 
the different combinations of property types and transaction types in the 
search parameters (e.g. apartments x sale, apartments x rent, case x sell, case x rent, etc.).
 It would be useful for the whole Romania
